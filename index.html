    <h2>Background:</h2>
    <p>I was born in Mission, TX and then moved to San Antonio with my family when I was 16. Currently, I reside in Austin, Texas where I've been for the last 4 years. I absoluetly love it here! While I would love to live outside of Texas for some time, I know Texas will always be "home" for me.</p>
