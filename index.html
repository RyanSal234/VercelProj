    <h1>Welcome to My About Me!</h1>
    <h2>Background:</h2>
    <p>I was born in Mission, TX, and then moved to San Antonio with my family when I was 16. Currently, I reside in Austin, Texas,<br>
    where I've been for the last 4 years. I absolutely love it here! While I would love to live outside of Texas for some time, I know<br>
    Texas will always be "home" for me.</p>
<br>
    <h2>Professional Experience:</h2>
    <p>I've always been in a customer-facing role, whether it was as a backup cashier at Hobby Lobby, a small business phone agent for Citibank,</p>
    <p>or a direct contact for national account buyers for C.H. Guenther & Son. Being able to build relationships with customers is something that </p>
    <p>I know I will <b>ALWAYS</b> want to do in my career. While I love what I do at BigCommerce, I'm looking for something that takes me deeper into</p>
    <p>the technical world, and I strongly believe that Vercel is a pioneer in this industry; your investors and success speak to that!</p>
<br>
    <h2>Interests:</h2>
    <p>During my downtime, I enjoy learning about new cultures and languages. Currently, I've been researching a lot about the Middle East and the</p>
    <p>Egyptian Arabic dialect. I think something about non-latin alphabets really peaks my interest because, prior to Arabic, I was studying Korean.</p>
    <p>I enjoyed Korean, but I think it was a little bit too easy to learn, so I went up a level (or two) with Arabic! When I need a break from studying,</p>
    <p>I like to play video games with my friends and catch up over voice chat. I have met people from all over the world throughout my years of gaming!</p> 
    <p>If the weather is nice, I'll go for a walk with my dog, Autumn. I've made it a goal for this year to focus on improving my health.</p>
<br>
    <h2>Additional talking points:</h2>
    <p>I would like to point out that this was my first time creating a page using HTML, GitHub, and Vercel! I researched on the side to ensure I knew the</p>
    <p> basics, and I've had so much fun putting this together. Thank you so much for giving me the opportunity to get a better understanding of Vercel and</p>
    <p> what many of your customers go through on a daily basis, though I'm sure their work is <b>MUCH</b> more involved than creating this page was!</p>
    
<br>
    
    Thank you for your time,
    Ryan
