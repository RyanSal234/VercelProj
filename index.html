    <h1>Welcome to My About Me!</h1>
    <h2>Background:</h2>
    <p>I was born in Mission, TX, and then moved to San Antonio with my family when I was 16. Currently, I reside in Austin, Texas,</p> 
    <p>where I've been for the last 4 years. I absolutely love it here! While I would love to live outside of Texas for some time, I know</p>
    <p>Texas will always be "home" for me.</p>

    <h3>Professional Experience:</h3>
    <p>I've always been in a customer-facing role whether it was as a back-up cashier at Hobby Lobby, a small business phone agent for Citibank,</p>
    <p>or a direct contact for national account buyers for C.H. Guenther & Son. Being able to build relationships with merchants is something that </p>
    <p>I know I will <b>ALWAYS</b> want to do in my career. While I love what I do at BigCommerce, I'm looking for something that takes me deeper into</p>
    <p>the technical world, and I strongly beleive that Vercel is making massive waves in said space. </p>
    
    
    <p>This is a basic HTML page.</p>
    <p>I like to do</p>
